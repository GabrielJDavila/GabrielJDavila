### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Davila, a front-end developer with experience designing and creating websites and web applications for small businesses. I love problem solving, finding solutions, and leaning into my creative toolkit to build projects. I'm also big into fitness, and like looking for ways to intergrate my two passions.

October 2023 - !! Finished the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path !!

### Some things I'm currently working on:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: A fitness journal app. This will be my most intricate project to date; users will be able to create their profile, create their own exercises and categories, and log workouts daily. They can also anylize their training and look at their PRs, best days, and track progress. I'm using React and Firebase so far, but open to using other technologies as well.

ðŸŒ± I'm looking to enroll in university to earn my B.S. in Software Engineering. I'm also learning to have a better understanding of Node.js, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.
