### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Davila, a front-end developer with experience designing and creating websites and web applications for small businesses. I love problem solving, finding solutions, and leaning into my creative toolkit to build projects. I'm currently developing my skills further with the Scrimba Front-End Bootcamp and Career Path, an online course that teaches you everything you need to know to be a great front-end developer with the best practices. I'm driven by curiosity and a need to challenge myself; web development ticks those boxes perfectly! I love collaberating with fellow developers, as it enhances not only my own skills but others as well, as we all learn from each other.

### Some things I'm currently working on:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: A Team Notes app for my current workplace. I am a fitness trainer at a small-group fitness studio, and we have many notes that we share amongst other trainers regarding clients, workout program notes, and current gym events. It would be nice to have a hub to collect this information and have an easy way to access it. I'm currently working on creating it through React and Firebase.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React through the Scrimba Bootcamp. I'm also learning Firebase on the side, as it is something I need to learn for projects I'm building on the side.
