### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Gabriel Davila, a front-end developer with experience designing and creating websites and web applications for small businesses. I love problem solving, finding solutions, and leaning into my creative toolkit to build projects. I'm also big into fitness, and like looking for ways to integrate my two passions.
